STORY LINE-
You find yourself on a mysterious island, filled with hidden dangers and untold riches. As the game begins, you’re greeted with a message welcoming you to Treasure Island. Your mission is clear: explore the island, make the right choices, and uncover the treasure. But beware—one wrong decision could spell doom.

HOW IT WORKS-
1. The Adventure Begins:
 The game starts with an introduction, setting the stage for your adventure. You are at the entrance of the island, and the journey awaits. The first decision comes quickly as you reach a crossroad.
2. Choices and Consequences: At the crossroad, you must choose to go either left or right.
   -Going right immediately leads to disaster, as you fall into a hole and the game ends.
   -Going left continues your adventure, bringing you to a lake.
3. Lake Decision: Upon reaching the lake, you must choose to either wait for a boat or swim across.
   -If you wait, you safely reach the island where the treasure lies.
   -If you swim, you’re attacked by a shark, ending your journey.
4. Final Challenge-
   -The Doors:
   After safely arriving at the island, you face the ultimate test: three doors, each a different color—red, yellow, and blue. Behind one of these doors lies the treasure.
   -If you choose the yellow door, you win and find the treasure.
   -Choosing the red or blue door results in losing the game.

GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS-
1.User Interaction: The player’s choices drive the game forward. The game asks the player for input at various stages, which determines the path they take.
2.ASCII Art for Visual Appeal:
